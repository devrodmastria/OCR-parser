# OCR-parser
Web API for Android client: https://github.com/rmesquit/XamarinAndroid-ImageUploader
<p>Credits to Evan from Lake Trust Credit Union for helping me build this parser.</p>
<p>This solution works with the Android client. To execute it, look for the "Conveyor by Keyote" extension window on Visual Studio, get the HTTP IP address from it, and paste it on the Android solution, in the Main activity (line 53) of the Xamarin Android image uploader app (repo link above)</p>
